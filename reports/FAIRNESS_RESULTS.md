# Fairness Analysis Results

No fairness groups available in test dataset.

## Demographic Subgroup Performance

AUC by subgroup (test set) computed for available demographics. Subgroups with n<50 or single-class outcomes were excluded.

- Age Cohort: AUC range 0.823–0.889

- Race/Ethnicity: AUC range 0.817–0.886

- Sex: AUC range 0.866–0.872


Implications: Monitor for performance drift and parity across groups; transparently report disparities before clinical deployment. Additional data may be needed for underrepresented groups.
