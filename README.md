Predicting Smoking Cessation Success Using Machine Learning: A Multi-Model Approach with Longitudinal Survey Data
Authors: Ananda Downing, Angel Nivar
Course: Data Mining
Institution: [Your University]
Timeline: 8 weeks (October - December 2025)

üìã Project Overview
Smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. This project develops machine learning models to predict smoking cessation success one year after a quit attempt, using the TUS-CPS 2010-2011 Longitudinal Cohort ‚Äì a nationally representative sample where baseline smokers were re-interviewed after one year to assess cessation outcomes.
Research Question
What individual characteristics, behavioral patterns, and quit strategies best predict successful smoking cessation one year after a quit attempt?
Key Contributions

Novel application of SHAP values for interpretable cessation prediction using longitudinal data
Evaluation of quit method combinations (e.g., NRT + counseling) rather than single interventions
Fairness assessment across demographic subgroups to ensure equitable public health application
Interactive dashboard for exploring model predictions and explanations


üéØ Project Goals

Predict 30+ day smoking abstinence at 1-year follow-up among baseline smokers who made a quit attempt
Engineer 25-35 features from demographics, smoking history, nicotine dependence indicators, and cessation methods
Compare multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Interpret model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
Develop actionable insights for public health interventions

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Ethical Considerations
Data Limitations

Temporal: Data from 2010-2011 predates widespread e-cigarette use and newer cessation products
Self-reported outcomes: No biochemical verification (cotinine testing)
30-day abstinence: Early marker, not long-term sustained cessation (6+ months)
Generalizability: US population sample may not generalize internationally

Ethical Considerations

Model is for educational and research purposes only
Not medical advice ‚Äì individuals should consult healthcare professionals
Fairness audits conducted to identify performance disparities across demographic groups
All limitations transparently documented

Responsible Use
This model should inform, not replace, clinical judgment. Predictions should be interpreted alongside patient preferences, clinical context, and evidence-based guidelines.
