Predicting Smoking Cessation Success Using Machine Learning
A Multi-Model Approach with Longitudinal Survey Data

Authors: Ananda Downing, Angel Nivar
Course: Data Mining
Timeline: 8 weeks (October - December 2025)

Project Overview
Smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. This project develops machine learning models to predict smoking cessation success one year after a quit attempt, using the TUS-CPS 2010-2011 Longitudinal Cohort – a nationally representative sample where baseline smokers were re-interviewed after one year to assess cessation outcomes.
Research Question
What individual characteristics, behavioral patterns, and quit strategies best predict successful smoking cessation one year after a quit attempt?
Key Contributions

Novel application of SHAP values for interpretable cessation prediction using longitudinal data
Evaluation of quit method combinations (e.g., NRT + counseling) rather than single interventions
Fairness assessment across demographic subgroups to ensure equitable public health application
Interactive dashboard for exploring model predictions and explanations


Data Source
Dataset: Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) 2010-2011 Longitudinal Cohort

Design: True longitudinal cohort (baseline May 2010 → follow-up May 2011)
Sample Size: Approximately 2,400-2,500 baseline smokers with complete follow-up data
Target Variable: 30+ days smoking abstinence at follow-up
Features: Demographics, smoking history, nicotine dependence, cessation methods
Data Access: Publicly available from NCI TUS-CPS

Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing data using multiple imputation
Outlier detection using IQR and z-score methods
Train/validation/test splits (60%/20%/20%) with stratification
Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance

Feature Engineering
Demographic Features

Age groups, education level, income, employment status, geographic region

Smoking History

Cigarettes per day, pack-years, age started smoking, years as smoker
Previous quit attempts, time to first cigarette

Cessation Methods

NRT usage (patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, nasal spray)
Prescription medications (varenicline, bupropion)
Behavioral support (counseling, quitline)
Multi-method combinations

Contextual Factors

Household smoking, workplace policies, health insurance coverage

Interaction Features

High dependence × NRT use
Prescription medication × counseling

Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression (baseline interpretable model)
Random Forest (ensemble method with feature importance)
XGBoost (gradient boosting for performance)

Evaluation Metrics

ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall AUC
Confusion matrices
F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy
Fairness metrics across demographic subgroups

Model Interpretation

SHAP values for global and local explanations
Feature importance rankings
Interaction effect analysis

Expected Outcomes
Performance Target: ROC-AUC > 0.70
Hypothesized Key Predictors:

Nicotine dependence (time to first cigarette)
Multi-method cessation approaches (NRT + counseling)
Socioeconomic factors (education, income)
Previous quit attempt history

Public Health Insights:

Identify high-risk relapse profiles
Recommend optimal cessation method combinations
Inform targeted intervention strategies


Limitations
Data Limitations

Temporal: Data from 2010-2011 predates widespread e-cigarette use and newer cessation products
Self-reported outcomes: No biochemical verification (cotinine testing)
Follow-up duration: 30-day abstinence is an early marker, not long-term sustained cessation
Generalizability: US population sample may not apply internationally

Ethical Considerations
This model is for educational and research purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice. Individuals seeking to quit smoking should consult qualified healthcare professionals.
Fairness audits will be conducted to identify performance disparities across demographic groups. All limitations will be transparently documented in the final report.
